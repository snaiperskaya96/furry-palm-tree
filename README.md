Dynamic ADS alignment prototype
===

Centuries ago I've made this project to figure out how doable it would be to align guns in ADS without animation support and test other ghetto solutions for things like legs in first person.

Now i'm releasing this publicly in case you beautiful reader might get some inspiration from it.

Please note that some of the assets might be copy-righted, I actually don't remember what is what and where I possibly bought stuff from, so I'm realising this under a double license:

**You can do the fuck you want with the source code; You are NOT allowed to use any of the non-code (.cpp/.h) assets for anything other than testing this thing out.**

I genuinely don't remember much about this project, I just made sure this runs on UE4 4.26, stripped it out of some unnecessary files (some content might not be available - such as some levels) and pushed it here. 

Code is put together so that stuff worked ASAP rather than putting too much thought into it so do not expect anything from it, I'd probably would do it differently for anything more than a prototype.
